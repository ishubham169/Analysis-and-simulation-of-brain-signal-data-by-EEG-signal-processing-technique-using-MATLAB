Emotion recognition by computers is becoming increasingly popular. Our 1st study is focused on recognizing emotion from human brain activity, measured by EEG signals using Emotive. We have proposed a system to analyze EEG signals and classify them into 2 classes (positive and negative emotion). This system was designed using prior knowledge from other research, and is meant to assess the quality of emotion recognition using EEG signals in practice. In order to perform this assessment, we have gathered a raw EEG data recording of 5 subjects in order to classify emotions .The 2nd study of this project focused on recognizing emotion from human brain activity, measured by EEG signals using BIOPAC. This was done by measuring EEG signals from people that were emotionally stimulated by meditation. The Conventional methods employ the analysis of EEG data that includes ICA i.e. Independent Component Analysis for pre processing of data which is removal of artifacts and extracting features like Energy, Power.
